# conflict
A simultaneous turn strategy game

The objective for this programming project is to polish up on coding skills,
emulate some software development, and even model a client relationship.

Conflict is meant to be a strategy game where players plan out their next turns
and then execute them, potentially interfering with the opposing players actions.

The initial prototype will be coded through Java, and ran through the console.

The Java portion, on 2/2/2023, was abandoned, renamed to conflictJava, and code will be continued in C++ (as that experience is more relevant to my interests)
